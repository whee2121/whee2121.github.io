        <p>Hello! My name is London. I enjoy video games, theatre, reading, drawing/digital art, and writing. I am currently a Marketing major, as I find that to be interesting and a good use of most of my skills. <br> I've been told I dress like Gonzo (yes, the Muppet.). I am an ENFP according to my roommate. As you can tell by the photo, I have a job, though I won't say where. If you have more questions, let me know!</p>
