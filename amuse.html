        <h1>Websites that I Find Amusing/Interesting</h1>
        <h3>by London Wheeler</h3>
        <p>I love trying to find weird or funny websites and videos. I love the bizarre and unusual things though, so <em>fair warning.</em></p>
     

        <h2>Do You Want to Slap Someone with a Eel?</h2>
        <p> Well now you can! This website allows us to slap a man back and forth with an eel. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The word Cornobble means "to slap someone with a dead fish". Bet you did not know that! (I do not know why I do, though.)</p>
        <a href="https://eelslap.com/">Slap! That! Man!</a>

        <h2>Oh god, <em>Chicken on a Raft</em></h2>
        <p>I shudder at the thought of this website. This website plays the song "Chicken on a Raft" for as log as you stay on the website. The goal is to endure it for as long as possible, no muting, just "Chicken on a Raft". <br> My old friend Lucas once managed to stay on that website for over 24 hours. I don't know how.</p>
        <a href="https://chickenonaraft.com/">The Terror of Chicken on a Raft</a>

        <h2><strong>GUILT</strong></h2>
        <p>This is dumb, this is stupid. This is a Muppets blooper my friends and I quote constantly. I don't know why Gonzo said it, but it has made my life better.<br> I had it stuck in my head during my Legal Business class, as the teacher was explaining what is considered battery. I must have looked like a psycho hiding my laughter as my brain kept repeating this video, while my professor described hitting someone with a chair. So sue me.</p>
