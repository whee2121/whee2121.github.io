<h1>British zoo is trying to get group of bird to stop cursing</h1>
<h2> Yes, you heard that correct</h2>
<p> Lincolnshire Wildlife Park was donated 5 African grey parrots with... ehem, <strong>interesting</strong> language. They love saying curse words. How are we solving this?</p>
<p> Putting more cursing birds together. Yeah, you heard me right. <em>They're putting 3 more birds with the group.</em></p>
<p>Okay, that's not all. They're putting the 8 cursing birds with the rest of the other birds, and praying that they rub off on eachother. So will there soon be 100 cursing birds at the Lincolnshire Wildlife Park? Only time will tell.</p>
